# Minesweeper ðŸŽ®

> Minesweeper is a classic puzzle game that challenges players to clear a grid of hidden mines without detonating any. The game is played on a grid of squares, some of which contain mines. The objective is to uncover all the squares that do not contain mines and mark all squares that contain mines.

> I chose to create this game because it allowed me to explore and apply new techniques, specifically ***Recursion*** **â€” a programming method where a function calls itself to simplify complex problems.** I saw this as an opportunity to learn and challenge myself while working on something meaningful. Additionally, Iâ€™ve always loved playing Minesweeper, especially on the expert difficulty, which made this project even more exciting and personal.
